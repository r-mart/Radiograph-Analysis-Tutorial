--------

## Install

- create a new python environment using your preferred environment manager
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- install the pytorch version suited to your system. See [Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

## Get Started

- start with the exercise notebooks. They provide the general architecture for classification and detection training and prediction. The core implementation is left empty. These locations are marked with 'TODO'.
- there are many ways to finish the implementation. One example is shown in the corresponding non-exercise notebooks. It may refer to code inside the 'src' module. Feel free to use the non-exercise notebooks as starting point for experiments or new ideas.
